Hello! I do stuff or something.

I am a lover of modded Minecraft who is currently working on Arcane Virtue, an expert modpack focused on magical arts.

I also like to make datapacks, which you can see in Repurposed Repurposed Structures.

I release my things under the public domain where possible. This means you can do whatever the heck you like with them, you could learn from them, copy from them, eat them... but I wouldn't recommend the last option. If you were a soulless lunatic you could even sell them while claiming they were yours, but I hope you're above that.
